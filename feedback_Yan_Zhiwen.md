- [ ] Make changes to your code from weeks 3 to 5 according to the feedback below. This will form part of your summative assessment. (You may use the checkboxes to keep track of your progress) 


## Feedback:

### Feedback Week 3:

- [ ]  The folder for Practical 3 should contain a file called thingsIlike.txt that lists things you like. Please push this to your GitHub repo.
- [ ] The folder for Practical 3 should contain a file called Reflection.txt that contains a few reflections on the practical.

### Feedback Week 4:

- [ ] In file collatz.py there is no pseudocode that documents the code. Add a little bit of pseudocode to explain what parts of the script (and the script as a whole) do. 

### Feedback Week 5:

The code for week 5 is great. There is no need to change anything.
